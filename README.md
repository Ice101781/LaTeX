===

&nbsp; These notes attempt to make accessible to the technically-curious retail trader some expressions for the first and second derivatives of the European-style put option price with respect to strike. An understanding of these formulas is the basis for further study into options-implied Black-Scholes risk-neutral distributions. Sections I and II find formulas for the 'Strike-Delta' (K-Delta) and 'Strike-Gamma' (K-Gamma) in the contexts of Martingale Pricing and the Black-Scholes-Merton Pricing Model, respectively. The last section applies the method of finite-differencing to yield a third pair of identities which can be used to approximate these Greeks.
